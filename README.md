Project Title: Analysis of Basic Financial Data

Basic Project Concept: In this project, we plan to take raw data and analyze it.  First, data will be put into a .txt file.  Then our program will graph the data (financial data) and then perform an analysis.  For example, let us say that the data contained years vs. Money earned.  Our program would graph the data as well as calculate the total ammount earned, and how much based on the data, money would be earned in following years.

Libraries: Graph libary
